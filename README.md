First React-app
I made a clone of tesla's homepage, because I always found the way the site works beautiful and smooth, so I thought I could do it, but it wasn't the same, however I feel very happy to have managed to do it (even if a simple way), it was my first App in React and using entirely Typescript.

Progress 
I started with a lot of problems, I don't get the things to use and how to use, but I made all again, with caution and with attention, obviously had a lot of bugs and these kinda things but one thing made me frustrating. The images, the images don't fit with the background, it became bigger or smaller than I needed, and 
I learned one thing "If you have a problem don't ignore or make another thing, keep going and you make the right way".

What did I learn from this?
Programming needs attention, just a word can bug your whole app, and patience to look for the problems and not freak out with them
